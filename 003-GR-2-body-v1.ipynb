It consists of two neutron stars, one of which is a recycled millisecond pulsar with a mass of about 1.34 solar masses, and the other a more slowly rotating companion weighing approximately 1.40 solar masses. These two ultra-dense remnants orbit each other in a highly eccentric path every 4.4 hours, making the system one of the most relativistic known in our galaxy. Several strong-field relativistic effects predicted by general relativity are clearly observed in this system. Among them is a rapid advance of periastron—the point of closest orbital approach—which proceeds at a remarkable rate of about 10.3651 degrees per year. This is one of the fastest such rates ever measured in a binary pulsar. In addition, the orbit is slowly shrinking due to the emission of gravitational waves, with the orbital period decaying at a rate of approximately 167 microseconds per year, leaving a calculated time to inspiral (coalescence) of some 76 million years. This decay matches the predictions of general relativity to an extraordinary degree of precision, reinforcing the theory’s accuracy under extreme conditions. Other relativistic phenomena also play a role, such as Shapiro delay, where the pulsar’s radio pulses are delayed as they pass through the gravitational field of the companion, and gravitational time dilation, where the pulsar’s timing is affected by variations in orbital velocity and gravitational potential. Together, these effects make PSR J1757–1854 a natural laboratory for testing Einstein’s theory in regimes inaccessible on Earth.  \n","The simulation matches the periastron advance (10.3 deg/year) and orbital decay (167 ms/year). It also provides a GW radiation of 4.3e+25 W which is some 6 times larger than that of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar (despite the similar total mass of both systems).

Its quasi periodic outbursts have been photographed for approximately 120 years. It is a super massive black hole binary (SMBHB). The primary BH mass is approx. 18.3 billion sun masses, the secondary BH is approx. 150 million sun masses. The quasi periodic outbursts stem from the secondary BH crossing the accretion disk of the primary BH twice in one orbit. The orbital period is currently approx. 12 years with a local relative periastron velocity of 0.27*c. The periastron distance (3'250 au) is approx. 9 times the Schwarzschild radius of the primary BH (361 au). The Schwarzschild radius of the secondary BH is approx. 3 au.

The orbital period reduces by 5 days each orbit.
